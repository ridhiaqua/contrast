November 9th, 2022 - a date etched in my memory forever. I was sitting at my desk constantly refreshing my outlook, praying that all the media reports about Meta's massive layoffs were a hoax. 

It was 10:59 am (GMT) and everyone was posting comments on one post that this news is false until it was 11 am. 

The post from Mark Zuckerberg brought my nightmare to reality. I was not prepared for it. Meta was laying off 11K people all across the verticals. 

And in just a couple of minutes, I found out I was one of the lucky ones in that lottery!

The Beginning 
============

At first, I was in shock. My dream job at Meta had just been snatched away from me, and I had no idea what to do next. 
But as the reality set in, I spiraled through a range of emotions - sadness, anger, and self-doubt. 
I couldn't help but wonder what I had done wrong, or if there was anything I could have done differently to avoid the layoff.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, I struggled to come to terms with what had happened. 
I had never experienced a layoff before, and the uncertainty and insecurity of it all was overwhelming. 
But with the support of my family and close friends, I eventually found the strength to pick myself up and start looking for a new opportunity.


Switching Gears
======================

I began my job search, and LinkedIn was my go-to tool. It wasn't easy. At first, the job search seemed daunting. Many companies were hesitant to sponsor my visa, which further limited my options. 
But I didn't let this deter me. I persevered, and eventually, I started getting interview calls.
However, I had a total of 68 interviews with multiple companies spanning all the way from December to March 2023. 

The process was exhausting and repetitive, and I was just wishing for it all to come to an end as soon as possible. 
I was constantly questioning if I was good enough or if I had made the right decisions. 
It was hard to stay positive, but I kept pushing forward, hoping that everything would fall into place soon enough.

Reflecting 
==============

Back in 2020, I was a survivor of the first layoff I had ever seen while I was working at Expedia. 
A bunch of my friends were impacted back then, and I thought I could understand what they were going through, 
but I didn't realize the depth of it until it actually happened to me. But this time around, I was determined to approach things differently. 
I refused to let the layoff consume me, and instead, I chose to embrace it as an opportunity to grow.

I am grateful for the support of my family and friends, who had my back throughout this process. 
They made me believe that this was not a setback, but rather a push to get out of something I had grown comfortable with. 
Their unwavering support gave me the courage to keep moving forward.


Light at the end of the tunnel
================

Slowly and gradually, things started looking up. 
I received job offers from some of the top companies in the industry, including TikTok, JP Morgan, Booking.com, and Expedia group. 
It was overwhelming, and I couldn't believe my luck.

In the end, the layoff was not the end of my career, 
but rather a turning point that propelled me to explore new opportunities and grow both professionally and personally. 

I'm proud of what I accomplished. I learned a lot about myself and my own resilience during this difficult time. 
I also learned that setbacks can often lead to even greater success, and I'm excited to see where this new chapter of my life takes me.
