Hello and welcome to my homepage. I am [Ridhi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridhi2301/), a software engineer with over 5 years of experience in the industry. <br /><br /> With a passion for taking end-to-end ownership of my work, I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality products while working with cross-functional teams. <br /><br />I have honed my skills at companies such as [Meta](https://about.meta.com/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb), and [Expedia](https://www.expediagroup.com/home/default.aspx), where I have been involved in various projects such as developing an index for the Consumer Insights Platform UI, creating a Goals API, and onboarding media and stateless services onto the Kubernetes-based deployment platform. <br /><br />In addition to my professional accomplishments, I am also proud to be a part of the [ACM FCA](https://medium.com/acmfca/fca-the-next-generation-1da6cf8d9b03) team, where I have been working with a non-profit organization to further the causes of computer science and technology. 
With a strong technical background, including expertise in languages such as Hack, React, and Java, and technologies like AWS, Kubernetes, and Rest, I am always eager to take on new challenges.
